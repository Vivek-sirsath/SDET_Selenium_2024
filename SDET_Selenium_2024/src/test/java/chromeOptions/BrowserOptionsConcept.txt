ChromeOptions (C)
EdgeOptions (C)
FirefoxOptions (C)

By using these classes we can do settings in browser.

1) Headless Testing
-------------------
        ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();
		options.addArguments("--headless=new");
		WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(options); // We've to pass the options here, else the browser will launch
		
Advantages: 
1) We can do multiple tasks. (Since execution happens in background)
2) Faster execution

Disadvantages:
1) User can not see actions on web page. Can't understand flow/functionality of test case.



2) SSL Handling (Secured Socket Layer)
--------------------------------------
        ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();
		options.setAcceptInsecureCerts(true); // By default it is false

		
		
3) Disable Message: "Chrome is being controlled by automated test software"	
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();
		options.setExperimentalOption("excludeSwitches", new String[] {"enable-automation"});	// 2 parameters here
        WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(options);
        
        
4) To run the test case in incognito mode.
------------------------------------------
        ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();
		options.addArguments("--incognito"); // setting for incognito mode 

		WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(options);

5) Enable Extensions In AutomatedBrowser
----------------------------------------
	    Step 1: Add CRX extractor/downloader to chrome browser (manually).
	    Step 2: Add selectorsHub plugin to chrome browser (manually).
	    Step 3: Capture CRX file for selectorsHub extension.
	    Step 4: Pass CRX file path in automation script in chrome options.
	
# CRX file is needed here.
# For every extension installed there is CRX file is available for every extension.
# 'CRX Extractor' is an installer for extension for browser to extract CRX file of the extension.
   We need to add this extension in browser.
# Open chrome web store for an extension which we want in our automation > Right click on that extension > We'll see the option 
  'Download CRX for this extension' > Save that CRX file to any desired location.
# Pass the path of that CRX file in the code as a parameter.
# Then we can see the extension in automated browser window.
# Manifest V3 is a new architecture for Chrome extensions.
# Use updated extensions of Manifest Version 3. Because Chrome is upgraded from Manifest V2 to Manifest V3.
  Hence some extensions may not work.

        ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();
		File path = new File("F:\\Automation Testing\\CRX Files\\uBlock-Origin-LiteMV3.crx");
		options.addExtensions(path);
		WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(options);
