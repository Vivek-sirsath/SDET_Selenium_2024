Shadow DOM: 

DOM: Document Object Model
- DOM will be created when the web page is loaded.

SHADOW DOM:
- A main DOM contains another DOM, which is called SHADOW DOM.
- SHADOW DOM can have another SHADOW DOM.
- XPath can not handle SHADOW DOM elements. Even other locating strategies won't work.
- Only cssSelector can handle SHADOW DOM elements.

Hierarchy:
- Document > Shadow Host > Shadow Root > Inside the Shadow Root we can find the elements.
- Shadow Root is a part of Shadow Host, Shadow Root contains the WebElements.
- Shadow Host contains Shadow Root and Shadow Root contains elements.
- DOM can contain Nested-Shadow-DOM, and inside Nested-Shadow-DOM there are nested shadow elements


  Document Tree:-
             
               DOCUMENT
                  |
        --------------------
        |                  |
   SHADOW HOST        SHADOW HOST
        |
   SHADOW ROOT

- Elements inside Shadow DOM can not be located by XPath, those can only be located by CSSSelector. 

e.g. 

	--> https://dev.automationtesting.in/shadow-dom
	
    SearchContext shadow0 = driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("#shadow-root")).getShadowRoot();
    String element1 = shadow0.findElement(By.cssSelector("#shadow-element")).getText();  
    System.out.println("1st shadow element text is:- " + element1);
