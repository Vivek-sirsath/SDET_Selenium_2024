Parallel Testing :-

1) Created test cases.
2) Created XML file to run the test cases.
3) Passed browser name parameter in XML file and received in setup() method.
4) Create 3 different test tags containing different browser names.
   Create it by Copy - Paste , just change the TestName and browser value.
5) Execute the test cases on different browsers as 'TestNG Suite'. (Serial Execution)  
6) Execute the test cases on different browsers as 'TestNG Suite'. (Parallel Execution)
   This is done by specifying 'parallel' attribute in XML file.
   e.g. parallel="tests"
   By this, the test methods will run parallel.
