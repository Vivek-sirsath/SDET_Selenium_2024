There are three types of dropdowns - 
1) Select Dropdown - having select tag
2) Bootstrap Dropdown - Having div or other tags but not select tag
3) Hidden Dropdown - Having div or other tags but not select tag

===================================================================

1) Select Dropdown:-
   In select dropdown we can select only one option from dropdown menu.

   getOptions() - return all the options from the dropdown as a WebElement.
   Every option in a dropdown is a WebElement.

   <select id="Country">
   <option value="In">India<option>
 
 # Built-In methods  
   // sel.selectByVisibleText("India");
   // sel.selectByValue("france"); // Case Sensitive
   // sel.selectByIndex(2);
   
=================================================================
 
2) Bootstrap Dropdown / Multiselect Dropdown:- 
   In Bootstrap dropdown we can select multiple options from dropdown menu.
   XPath is very important in handling this dropdown. We don't use Built-In methods.

================================================================= 

3) Hidden Dropdown:-
   The dropdown options which are visible in the dropdown 
   But, they are not visible in the HTML DOM, hence they are called hidden dropdown.
   XPath is very important in handling this dropdown. We don't use Built-In methods.

# Here we need to use 'Turn on debugger' feature of 'SelectorsHub'
  Click on the 4th icon-'Turn on debugger' > Within 5 sec. click on the dropdown >
  > All the hidden options will be appearing in DOM > Then we can inspect.
